## Hypotheses

# Data

```{r cleaning, include=FALSE}
source("scripts/input.R", encoding = 'UTF-8')
```

## Raw data

## Analytical dataset

All variables in the analytical set were labeled according to the raw data provided and values were labeled according to the data dictionary for the preparation of production-quality results tables and figures.

After the cleaning process `r ncol(analytical)` variables were included in the analysis with `r nrow(analytical)` observations.
Table 1 shows the structure of the analytical dataset.

```{r analytical data}
analytical_mockup %>%
  pander(caption = "**Table 1** Analytical dataset structure after variable selection and cleaning.")
```

The analytical dataset will be included in the private version of the report, and will be omitted from the public version of the report.

# Study variables
